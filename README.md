## A window application supporting the management of patients' medical data written in python using libraries such as tkinter, FHIRpy, etc...
------------------------
The aim of the project was to create an application that acts as a simple electronic patient card. In particular, an application that uses the FHIR standard to download and update data from a selected testing server and allows the data to be presented in a readable form taking into account their time aspect.
